## this are the steps i took to make this work
## i'm including this because you can use this same process if you find some other library
## of note, the downloaded code probably has <.gitignore> files in it
## if you don't delete these, then those ignored files will be, well, ignored, when pushed

//
##procedure from a clean codespace:

mkdir packages

##drag libsodium-stable into packages 
##[this may take a while]

cd ./packages/libsodium-stable

chmod +x configure
./configure
make && make check
sudo make install

cd ..
cd ..

mkdir CMake
## drag FindSodium.cmake into CMake folder

~~~~~
###CMakeLists.txt edited to have AT LEAST the following:
## set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake)
## find_package(Sodium)
## target_link_libraries(project sodium)
~~~~

## make sure #include <sodium.h> is in top of file
## make sure sodium_init() is run before calling other sodium stuff

## sets up /build/ folder for cmake, only has to run once
cmake -S . -B ./build 

## actually does the compiling
cmake --build ./build

./build/project
